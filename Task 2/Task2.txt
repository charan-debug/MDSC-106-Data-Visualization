1.Data Understanding and Preparation:

A. Read both the Datasets ‘Data1’ and ‘Data 2’ as DataFrame and store them into two separate variables.

B. Print shape and Column Names and DataTypes of both the Dataframes.

C. Merge both the Dataframes on ‘ID’ feature to form a single DataFrame

D. Change Datatype of below features to ‘Object’

‘CreditCard’, ‘InternetBanking’, ‘FixedDepositAccount’, ‘Security’, ‘Level’, ‘HiddenScore’.

[Reason behind performing this operation:- Values in these features are binary i.e. 1/0. But
DataType is ‘int’/’float’ which is not expected.]


2.Data Exploration and Analysis:

A. Visualize distribution of Target variable ‘LoanOnCard’ and clearly share insights.

B. Check the percentage of missing values and impute if required.

C. Check for unexpected values in each categorical variable and impute with best suitable value.
[Unexpected values means if all values in a feature are 0/1 then ‘?’, ‘a’, 1.5 are unexpected
values which needs treatment ]
